Create a Flask web app for contract/template management with these features:

1. Use SQLite (via Flask-SQLAlchemy) to store contract templates with fields: title, category, content.

2. On first run, pre-populate the database with the following contract templates (each with basic placeholder content including variables in curly braces):

3. Main page lists all templates with options to create new, edit, and delete.

4. Template content supports variables inside curly braces, e.g. {client_name}, {start_date}.

5. When generating a contract, automatically detect variables and display a form to fill them.

6. Include an HTML5 canvas for users to draw an e-signature using Signature Pad JS library.

7. On form submit, combine the filled variables with the template content and capture the signature as base64 PNG.

8. Show a preview page displaying the filled contract text and the signature image.

9. Provide a button to download the contract as a PDF with the embedded signature using WeasyPrint.

10. Use Bootstrap 5 for UI styling and responsiveness.

11. No user login/authentication; all templates are global.

12. Routes:

- `/` - list all templates  
- `/create-template` - create new template form  
- `/edit-template/<id>` - edit template form  
- `/delete-template/<id>` - delete template action  
- `/generate-contract/<id>` - fill variables + capture signature  
- `/download-pdf` - POST route to generate and download PDF  

Provide full Python Flask code (app + models + routes), HTML templates with Bootstrap, and JavaScript for signature pad integration.

Use WeasyPrint for PDF generation.

After generating, please explain how to install dependencies, run the app, and test it on Replit.
